    "As I embarked upon completing assignmnet 1 of the Algorithms & Data Structures module, the first learning opportunity was the use of the hash function which will randomly assign a question number me to be by entering an input string containing our first names in lower case. I was assigned question 1 by the hash function. Answering the question required to write a python function that either identifies the first integer in a given list that has a duplicate or in its absence returns -1. The way I decided to approach the problem was to first right the outer function which was to iterate over all terms in the given list. In python code it was for i in range(len(nums). Then I pondered over the additional for loop layer which will further iterate over range (len(nums) - 1) for each element int the list. This led me to drafting the following function:\n",

    "    return -1\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of assignment 2, I was asked to review my partners code of attempting a different problem. The first step was to understand the question which required writing a python code which will detect if brackets are placed in the write order in a given string. Reviewing the code, I was able to analyze that they had written an extensive for loop which tracked open brackets in a list and removes a matching one when a closing bracket is found. The code was simple enough to be understood however I realized the importance of commentary to help with readability."
